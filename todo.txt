Systems:
- rendering colored tiles
	- draw character, draw transparent color on top of character
		- is that how that works?
	- character map file and color map file? and collision map file?
		- all in same file?
		- they're most likely going to be stored in separate arrays anyways
	- alternative file structure built by program?
- text box popup system
	- can cycle through text
- view system
	- blinking cursor to move around to get descriptions of the environment
		- movement no longer controls player, but cursor
		- just dwarf fortress
	- certain background tiles have descriptions
		- where is that stored?
		- bottom of room file, list of descriptions with coordinates
			- eg. 5 8 The neighbors dog. Ugly but in a cute kind of way.
- alternate view system
	- on each screen you can look at a view of the whole screen from player(ish) POV
