Systems:
- rendering colored tiles
	- steps to drawing map:
		x draw colorless map from file
		x draw colorless map from file with obj/struct
	x draw character, draw transparent color on top of character
		- is that how that works?
		- yeah, pretty much
	x character map file and color map file? and collision map file?
		- all in same file?
		- they're most likely going to be stored in separate arrays anyways
		- better idea:
			- array of objs/structs with fields
				- char
				- color
				- passible
				- door?
		- json with multiple arrays for char, color, collision
			- additional array of descriptions
			- arrays generated by map builder program
	- alternative file structure built by program?
x map drawer program
	x pick sprite and color
	x uses text popup system
- text box popup system
	x can cycle through text
	x specify:
		x text
		x input?
		x lines
		- speaker (with color? borrowed from obj?)
- view system
	- blinking cursor to move around to get descriptions of the environment
		- movement no longer controls player, but cursor
		- just dwarf fortress
	- certain background tiles have descriptions
		- where is that stored?
		- bottom of room file, list of descriptions with coordinates
			- eg. 5 8 The neighbors dog. Ugly but in a cute kind of way.
? alternate view system
	- on each screen you can look at a view of the whole screen from player(ish) POV
